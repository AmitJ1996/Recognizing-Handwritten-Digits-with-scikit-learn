# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn
Data analysis is not limited to numbers and strings, because images and sounds can also be analyzed and classified. 

Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents.

To address this issue in Python, the scikit-learn library provides a good example to better understand this technique, the issues involved, and the possibility of making predictions. scikit-learn python library is commonly used in solving machine learning and data science problem from the begging to the end. scikit-learn built on the machine learning libraries.

.Numpy

.Scipy

.Matplotlib

scikit-learn offers an extensive is range of built in algorithms that make the most of data science projects: here are the main ways the scikit-learn library is used.
